Firstly, the pitch range and baseline pitch of both recordings need to be compared. If they are similar, it suggests a potential match. Secondly, the voice quality and timbre, such as whether the voice is breathy, creaky, rough, or smooth, should be examined for consistency. Thirdly, resonance patterns and vocal tract characteristics, which contribute to the unique sound of a voice, should be analyzed. Fourthly, voice onset time and phonation patterns, which relate to how the voice is produced, should be considered.     In terms of articulatory analysis, the precision and consistency of articulation, distinctive consonant formations, vowel space, and pronunciation tendencies should be compared. Coarticulation patterns, which refer to how sounds influence each other in speech, are also important.    Speech pattern analysis involves examining rhythm patterns, natural pausing, stress and intonation patterns, idiosyncratic pronunciation habits, and any speech disfluencies or fillers.

Firstly, the pitch range and baseline pitch of both recordings need to be compared. If they are similar, it suggests a potential match. Secondly, the voice quality and timbre, such as whether the voice is breathy, creaky, or smooth, should be examined for consistency. Thirdly, resonance patterns and vocal tract characteristics, which contribute to the unique sound of a voice, are considered. Fourthly, voice onset time and phonation patterns are analyzed for similarities.    In terms of articulatory analysis, the precision and consistency of articulation, distinctive consonant formations, vowel space, and pronunciation tendencies are compared. Coarticulation patterns, which refer to how sounds influence each other in speech, are also examined.    Speech pattern analysis involves looking at rhythm patterns, natural pausing, stress and intonation patterns, idiosyncratic pronunciation habits, and any speech disfluencies or fillers.    Finally, it's important to account for variability, such as differences in speaking rate, emotional context, and content, to ensure that the analysis focuses on speaker-specific traits rather than contextual variations.

Audio 1 had a medium pitch range, while Audio 2 had a slightly lower pitch. The voice quality and timbre in Audio 1 were smooth and clear, whereas Audio 2 had a slightly rougher quality. Resonance patterns and vocal tract characteristics showed some differences, with Audio 1 having a more resonant quality. Voice onset time and phonation patterns were consistent in both recordings, but with slight variations in articulation.     In the articulatory analysis, Audio 1 demonstrated precise articulation with clear consonant formations, while Audio 2 had a more relaxed articulation style. Vowel space and pronunciation tendencies also differed, with Audio 1 having a more distinct vowel pronunciation. Coarticulation patterns were more fluid in Audio 1 compared to Audio 2.
