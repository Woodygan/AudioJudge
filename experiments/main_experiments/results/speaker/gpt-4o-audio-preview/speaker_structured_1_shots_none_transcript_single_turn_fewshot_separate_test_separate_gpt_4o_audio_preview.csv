The voice quality also differs, with AUDIO 1 having a more nasal timbre and AUDIO 2 having a clearer resonance. Articulation style in AUDIO 1 is less precise compared to the more distinct enunciation in AUDIO 2. Speech rhythm in AUDIO 1 is slower and more deliberate, whereas AUDIO 2 is faster and more fluid. There are no shared idiosyncratic features that would suggest the same speaker. The contextual factors, such as the emotional tone and content, are also different, which could influence the vocal delivery but do not account for the fundamental differences in vocal characteristics.",False,structured,speaker,1,none,False,False,False,False
