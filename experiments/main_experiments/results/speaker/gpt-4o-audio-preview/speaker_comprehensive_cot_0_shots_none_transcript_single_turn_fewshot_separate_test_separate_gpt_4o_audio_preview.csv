Firstly, the pitch range and baseline pitch of both clips need to be compared. If the pitch range and baseline pitch are consistent, it suggests a similarity. Secondly, the voice quality and timbre should be examined for similarities in breathiness, creakiness, roughness, or smoothness. Thirdly, resonance patterns and vocal tract characteristics should be analyzed to see if they match. Fourthly, voice onset time and phonation patterns are considered to identify any unique characteristics.     In terms of articulatory analysis, the precision and consistency of articulation, distinctive consonant formations, vowel space, and pronunciation tendencies are compared. Coarticulation patterns are also examined for consistency.     Speech pattern analysis involves comparing rhythm patterns, natural pausing, stress and intonation patterns, idiosyncratic pronunciation habits, and any speech disfluencies or fillers.     Finally, variability is accounted for by differentiating speaker-specific traits from contextual variations, considering the effects of speaking rate, emotional context, and content, and accounting for within-speaker variability across different contexts.
