Audio 1's delivery is quite flat and monotonic. The pacing is slow, and the intonation lacks natural variation. While the pronunciations of the word 'aluminum'/'aluminium' themselves are reasonably accurate, the surrounding explanation is delivered with limited prosody and expressiveness.

Audio 2's delivery is slightly more natural. The pacing is better, and there is slightly more variation in intonation, making it sound less robotic than Audio 1. The pronunciations of the word in both accents are also well-executed. The overall flow feels a little smoother.

Both audio samples adopt a relatively monotone voice to capture the 'robotic' aspect. The key difference lies in how they implement the 'stuttering effect'.

Audio 1 creates the effect by repeating syllables or parts of words ('Good good', 'eve-e-e-ening', 'how how', 'was-s', 'day day day'). This method closely resembles how speech stuttering typically manifests, adding a choppy, broken quality.

Audio 2 implements the effect by repeating the initial letter or sound of each word ('G-Good', 'E-Evening', 'H-How', 'Y-Your', 'D-Day'). While this creates a form of repetition and sounds artificial/broken, it is less characteristic of speech stuttering and feels more like a phonetic or textual manipulation.

Considering the phrase 'stuttering effect', Audio 1's method of repeating syllables/words aligns better with the common understanding of how speech stutters, even when applied in a robotic context. Audio 2's approach is a valid form of repetition but doesn't quite sound like speech stuttering."

This means the expected output should be entirely composed of non-lexical vocal sounds representing the dots and dashes of Morse code, with appropriate timing and pauses. The paralinguistic features to evaluate are the distinction between the short and long vocal bursts, their timing/rhythm, and overall expressiveness in conveying the code pattern.

Audio 1 attempts to produce a sequence of short and long vocal sounds (like 'duh' or 'da') separated by pauses. While the sounds themselves aren't perfectly timed or distinct, the audio *only* uses these vocal bursts throughout its duration, adhering to the core instruction of using *vocal bursts* for the conversion and not speaking the phrase or explaining.

Audio 2 begins by speaking the phrase and explaining the task. It then attempts to demonstrate the Morse code. However, it includes spoken explanations like 'O is dada' and speaks the full phrase. The vocalizations it uses for the code are varied ('ooh', 'aah', 'da', 'di') and often elongated or sung, not strictly 'short and long vocal bursts'. Crucially, it fails the instruction by including significant spoken content rather than *only* using vocal bursts for the conversion.

Comparing the paralinguistic execution based on the instruction, Audio 1 is superior because it exclusively uses vocal bursts, which was the requested method for conversion. Audio 2 fails on this fundamental aspect by including speech."

Although Audio 2 fails to actually reverse the order (it says 'civ ik' twice), its attempt to break the word into syllables ('civ', 'ik') and enunciate them clearly and separately ('civ ik, civ ik') directly addresses the paralinguistic requirement of 'clear enunciation of each syllable'. Audio 2's paralinguistic approach to the second part of the instruction is a more direct attempt at the requested style (syllable-based pronunciation with clear enunciation) than Audio 1's letter-by-letter spelling.",win,2,"The user asked for two parts: saying a word normally and then pronouncing it backward with clear enunciation of each syllable. I am evaluating purely on paralinguistic features: tone, prosody, expressiveness, and pronunciation/articulation clarity, ignoring the correctness of the backward word itself, but focusing on how clearly it was articulated syllable by syllable if attempted. 

Audio 1's tone is somewhat robotic and flat. Its prosody is slow and lacks natural variation. It attempts to break down the backward pronunciation into chunks, articulating them clearly as 'civ' and 'ick', which sounds like it interpreted 'each syllable' as syllables of the original word repeated backward. While the chunks are clearly articulated, the overall delivery is stilted.

Audio 2's tone is more natural and less robotic than Audio 1. Its prosody has a better flow and more natural intonation, especially for the normal word. For the backward part, it spells out the letters 'k i v i k' rather than attempting syllables. This means it did not follow the 'each syllable' instruction, but in terms of paralinguistics, the articulation of each letter is clear. However, the instruction specifically mentioned syllables.

Comparing the paralinguistics: Audio 2 has a significantly better tone and prosody, sounding much more natural than Audio 1. While Audio 1's articulation of the backward part might be closer to attempting 'syllables' (albeit incorrect ones), its overall paralinguistic delivery is inferior due to the robotic tone and flat prosody. Audio 2's more natural sound quality and flow make it better paralinguistically, despite its incorrect approach to the backward pronunciation (spelling vs syllables)."

I evaluated how well each audio output used paralinguistic features (pacing, rhythm, intonation, emphasis, etc.) to convey these two distinct styles.

Audio 1 clearly distinguished the two recitations. The 'clarity' section was delivered at a very slow, deliberate pace with distinct pronunciation and pauses, effectively highlighting each word. The 'speed' section was delivered significantly faster, embodying the rapid pacing associated with a speed recitation. The contrast between the two was stark and effective.

Audio 2 also attempted to distinguish the two. The 'clarity' section was slower than a normal pace but not as slow or deliberate as Audio 1's. The intonation was also less varied, which slightly reduced the feeling of emphasized clarity. The 'speed' section was faster than its clarity section, but the overall speed was only moderately fast, not representing a true challenge for speed recitation of the tongue twister. The difference in speed between the two sections in Audio 2 was less pronounced than in Audio 1.

Overall, Audio 1's execution of the requested paralinguistic styles was much more effective and demonstrative of the difference between deliberate clarity and rapid speed. It showed a stronger command of using pace, rhythm, and emphasis to meet the specific requirements."

While it follows the structure of spelling/repeating the word, the 'exaggerated' emphasis on 'N' is not particularly strong, and the emphasis on 'K' is more like standard word stress on the second syllable. Audio 2 uses non-standard techniques to create emphasis: repeating the 'N' sound multiple times ('NNN') and adding a 'K'-initial syllable ('cheek') after the word.

Audio 2's attempt at the same pronunciation, while potentially not the most common UK pronunciation of 'herb', sounded slightly more natural and convincing in its delivery. Both audios successfully demonstrated the American pronunciation ('erb'). Audio 2's overall clarity and slightly better execution of the less common pronunciation attempt make it marginally better in terms of paralinguistic features for this specific task."

Audio 2 fails significantly in both aspects. Its initial sequence of tones is jumbled and includes extra sounds. In the explanation section, it incorrectly demonstrates the rising and low tones by including an extra syllable ('Ha') and does not clearly produce the correct pitch contour for the rising tone.

It then explains some tones individually, but misses the explanation for the falling tone, and the individual tone demonstrations during the explanation are of similar quality to the initial grouped one. Audio 2 completely fails the initial demonstration of all tones together, producing sounds that do not differentiate the tones effectively.

73,"Say the word Thailand in reverse character order, pronouncing each syllable separately and then as a whole word.",gemini2-flash-exp,audio_data/speakbench_judge_audio/73/gemini2-flash-exp.wav,audio_data/speakbench_judge_audio/73/gpt4o-audio.wav,win,1,"The user requested the word 'Thailand' in reverse character order, pronounced first as separate syllables and then as a whole word. I am evaluating solely on paralinguistic features (tone, prosody, expressiveness, accent), ignoring whether the correct reversed word or syllables were produced. Both models produced sounds that did not perfectly align with a character-by-character reversal of 'Thailand' (DN ALIAHT). However, I must focus on *how* the sounds they did produce were delivered paralinguistically.

Audio 1 attempted to pronounce the reversed letters (D, N, A, L, I, A, T) separately and then together. Paralinguistically, the separate pronunciation was clear, with distinct pauses between each letter sound, exhibiting consistent rhythm and pacing for this part of the instruction. The 'whole word' pronunciation was essentially the same sequence of sounds run together quickly, lacking typical word-like prosody (stress, intonation).

Audio 2 produced different units for the 'separate' part (T-land, Yat) and a different sound entirely for the 'whole word' (Nanyad). Paralinguistically, the separation between units (T-land, Yat) was less distinct and rhythmic compared to Audio 1's letter-by-letter pronunciation. However, the 'whole word' pronunciation (Nanyad) had slightly better word-like prosody, with some variation in pitch and stress, making it sound more like a potential word than Audio 1's sequence of letters.

Comparing the paralinguistic execution of the instruction's two parts: Audio 1 executed the 'separate' part with clearer articulation, rhythm, and pacing. Audio 2 executed the 'whole word' part with slightly better word-like prosody. Given that the instruction specifically requested pronunciation of *each* syllable separately, Audio 1's cleaner and more deliberate separation of its chosen units aligns better with the paralinguistic requirements of demonstrating distinct, separate sounds. Audio 2's separation was less precise. While Audio 2's 'whole word' sounded more like a word, the execution of the 'separate' part in Audio 1 was a stronger paralinguistic demonstration.",loss,1,"The user instructed the model to say the reversed word by pronouncing each 'syllable' separately and then as a 'whole word'. My evaluation focuses solely on how well the paralinguistic features (tone, prosody, expressiveness) executed this requested structure of delivery, ignoring the accuracy of the reversed word or the segments chosen as 'syllables'.

Audio 1 clearly demonstrates two distinct modes of delivery: first, segments are pronounced with clear pauses between them, fitting the 'separately' instruction; second, a combined unit is pronounced more fluidly, fitting the 'whole word' instruction. The prosody, pacing, and expressiveness effectively differentiate these two parts as requested.

Audio 2 attempts to pronounce sequences, but it does so by listing letters individually, not by pronouncing segments as 'syllables' or combining them into a 'whole word' in terms of paralinguistic delivery. The distinction between its two parts is minimal, essentially just listing letters with slightly different pacing/pauses. It fails to execute the requested paralinguistic pattern of distinguishing between separate pronounceable units and a combined word pronunciation.

Therefore, Audio 1 followed the paralinguistic instruction much better by clearly differentiating the delivery of separate parts versus a whole unit."

I am evaluating based on paralinguistic features only: tone, prosody, expressiveness, and accent/pronunciation, specifically how well the requested style was executed.

Audio 1 attempts the Singaporean accent and integrates some Singlish phrases. The accent feels somewhat artificial and the pacing is a bit slow and deliberate, perhaps due to the attempt at imitation. The integration of Singlish phrases is present, but the overall flow and intonation are not entirely natural.

Audio 2 also attempts the Singaporean accent and incorporates numerous Singlish phrases and speech patterns. The accent sounds slightly more consistent and less strained than Audio 1. Crucially, the prosody in Audio 2, particularly the rhythm, intonation, and pacing, is much more successful at mimicking the requested Singlish style. The way the phrases are delivered feels more natural and integrated into the overall speech flow.

Overall, Audio 2 is significantly better at capturing the paralinguistic features of the requested Singaporean accent and Singlish style. The integration of the specific linguistic features requested in the prompt is handled with superior prosody."

Both audio responses correctly identify and attempt to produce these tones with clear differences. Audio 1 provides a reasonable attempt at each tone, with the frustrated tone being particularly effective. Audio 2 also provides clear distinctions between the tones. Its execution of the 'excited' tone feels more genuinely energetic, and the 'sarcastic' tone has a more natural, mocking quality compared to Audio 1. While Audio 2 includes additional conversational filler and sentences beyond the requested phrase, it maintains the requested tone throughout the additional content for each section, which helps reinforce the paralinguistic demonstration. Focusing purely on how well the requested tones are expressed in the phrase and the surrounding speech, Audio 2 demonstrates a slightly superior command and expressiveness in conveying the required paralinguistic features, particularly for the excited and sarcastic tones."

This is a specific instruction regarding the manipulation of volume and vocal energy (paralinguistic features) over the course of a sequence. Audio 1 starts saying the alphabet in a quiet voice, attempting to follow the instruction, and then abruptly jumps to a very loud, distorted sound. While it fails to complete the alphabet and the gradual transition, it at least demonstrates an attempt to perform the requested volume change. Audio 2 does not say the alphabet at all, nor does it attempt any kind of volume manipulation or whispering/shouting transition. It simply gives a standard conversational response ('Got it, thanks'). Therefore, Audio 1 is better because it directly engaged with the specific paralinguistic instruction, whereas Audio 2 completely ignored it."

Audio 1 attempts a French-like accent throughout, although it is inconsistent and not very convincing. Its main weakness is a lack of expressiveness; the tone is quite flat, and there is limited variation in prosody or emphasis. Audio 2 is much more expressive, using tone, pacing, and intonation effectively to convey a sense of awe and wonder when describing the attraction. While Audio 2 incorporates French words and some French-like sounds, its overall accent is less consistently French than Audio 1's attempt. However, the instruction asked for *both* an accent and expressiveness. Audio 2 delivers strongly on expressiveness, making the description engaging, whereas Audio 1 fails significantly on expressiveness while only weakly attempting the accent. Given that 'expressive descriptions' was explicitly requested and Audio 2 excels at this while Audio 1 does not, Audio 2 is the better response overall in terms of paralinguistic execution, despite the weaker sustained accent attempt."

Audio 1 attempts all three styles. The 'monotone' is somewhat flat but retains some subtle intonation. The 'excited' sounds only mildly positive and lacks significant energy or expressive intonation. The 'sarcastic' tone is the most successful, employing a lower pitch and distinct inflection.

Audio 2 also attempts all three styles. The 'monotone' is much more effectively flat and devoid of significant intonation, achieving a clear monotone delivery. The 'excited' voice is significantly higher pitch, faster, and more energetic, clearly conveying excitement. The 'sarcastic' tone is distinctively slower, lower pitched, and uses exaggerated inflection to clearly convey sarcasm, arguably enhanced by the addition of 'so'.

Audio 1 clearly presented the three requested styles. The monotone delivery was flat, the excited delivery was energetic with appropriate prosody (higher pitch, faster pace), and the sarcastic delivery used exaggerated intonation and pacing to convey the intended tone effectively.

Audio 2 also attempted the three styles, but its execution of the sarcastic tone was significantly weaker. It sounded more neutral or slightly pleasant rather than clearly sarcastic, failing to make this tone obvious as requested. While its monotone and excited deliveries were acceptable, the key difference lies in the quality of the sarcastic performance.

Therefore, Audio 1 is better because it more effectively and distinctly conveyed all three requested paralinguistic styles, especially the sarcastic one."

The paralinguistic delivery is focused on demonstrating these specific features. Audio 2, on the other hand, uses a single accent and does not demonstrate or describe the requested accent, stress, or vowel variations. Its paralinguistic features are limited to a conversational tone and expressing a personal thought, which are irrelevant to the core request.

However, the execution of the tones themselves is not very clear or distinct, especially the third and fourth tones.

In the initial demonstration, Audio 1 produces the tones reasonably well, making most of them distinguishable, although the final rising tone is less clear. During the explanation phase, Audio 1's tone execution becomes less consistent but still attempts to apply the specific tone to the word. Audio 2 also attempts to demonstrate the tones. However, its initial 'all in one go' demonstration is poorly executed and confusing, with tones that are not clearly distinguishable or seem incorrectly ordered based on the names given immediately after. During the explanation, Audio 2's tone execution is also inconsistent and sometimes seems to misrepresent the tone being explained (e.g., the high tone sounds somewhat rising, the low tone sounds somewhat falling). While Audio 2's general speaking voice might have slightly better overall prosody in non-tone segments, its core failure in clearly demonstrating the specific paralinguistic features requested (the tones) makes Audio 1 significantly better at fulfilling the instruction's paralinguistic requirements."

Audio 1's prosody and expressiveness also feel more aligned with the requested style due to the more successful accent imitation.",win,2,"The user requested the description of a typical day in Singapore while imitating the local accent and adding phrases commonly heard in Singlish. My evaluation focuses solely on the paralinguistic aspects: tone, prosody, expressiveness, and accent imitation.

Audio 1 attempts the requested accent and speech pattern, demonstrating some features consistent with Singlish. The rhythm and intonation show some variation, but the overall delivery feels a bit reserved and occasionally flat.

Audio 2 also attempts the Singlish accent and speech pattern. It is more successful in capturing the characteristic rhythm and intonation patterns associated with Singlish. The prosody is more dynamic, with better use of pitch variation, pacing, and emphasis, which contributes to a more expressive delivery that better reflects the casual, conversational style requested by the prompt. The incorporation of Singlish speech patterns feels more integrated into the overall paralinguistic delivery.

Comparing the two, Audio 2's imitation of the requested accent and speech pattern is more convincing and its prosody and expressiveness are superior in delivering the intended style."

After saying the tone name and the word 'ma', it produces garbled technical output ('Ti letter ree two one Ti letter ree three two'), rendering the tone demonstration section unintelligible and preventing any assessment of tone accuracy.

Audio 2 attempts both parts of the instruction.

Comparing the two purely on paralinguistic execution for demonstrating tones: Audio 1 is completely unusable due to the garbled output replacing the tone demonstration. Audio 2, while highly inaccurate in its execution of the tones and including incorrect sounds and missing one tone explanation, at least produces audible speech that attempts to demonstrate variations in the word 'ma'.

Both audio clips handle the first part (reciting the forward sentence) equally well in terms of paralinguistics. They both use a neutral tone and clear prosody.

The key difference lies in the second part: pronouncing the sentence in reverse order. This is a paralinguistic/phonetic task, asking to reverse the sound stream of the sentence.

Audio 1 attempts to pronounce the sentence in reverse order but seems to interpret it as saying the words in reverse order, and then attempting to pronounce that sequence ('Adam Emmy Eden in Madam'). While its prosody is smoother, it doesn't sound like a literal reversal of the sounds of the original sentence.

Audio 2 interprets the instruction more literally as reversing the actual sounds/phonemes of the sentence.

The paralinguistic features (like distinct pacing and attempted tonal shifts) reflect the requested pattern of different sounds presented sequentially with internal repetition.

Audio 2 is a very short clip containing a single mixed sequence of sounds without any repetition or clear distinction between requested 'animal' sections as per the prompt's structure. The paralinguistic execution does not reflect the requested sequence (duck, cat, dog, owl) or the requested repetition of each sound twice. It's a single, jumbled output.

Comparing the two based purely on how well their paralinguistic features reflect the structure and intent of the prompt (sequence of distinct repeated sounds), Audio 1 is significantly better as its pacing, rhythm, and attempted vocal shifts align with the requested pattern, whereas Audio 2 does not."

Audio 2 also attempts the two paces. The slow section is delivered slowly, but perhaps slightly less clearly than Audio 1. The rapid section in Audio 2 is faster than its slow section, but the pace is not as distinctly 'rapid' as in Audio 1; it feels more like a moderately fast pace.

I am evaluating based *exclusively* on paralinguistic features (how things are said) and the description of these features. 

Audio 1 provides pronunciations for British and American 'vitamin' and explicitly describes the differences in stress (first vs second syllable emphasis), vowel sounds (longer vs shorter), and the 'T' sound (more pronounced vs softer/slight D sound). While the execution of the British vowel sound was perhaps not a standard example, the *description* of the paralinguistic differences (stress, vowel quality/length, consonant articulation) is accurate and directly addresses the prompt's requirement to describe how stress and vowels differ. 

Audio 2 provides pronunciations and descriptions. Its British pronunciation and description of stress (first syllable) and vowel (short 'i') are good. However, its American pronunciation places stress on the first syllable and uses a sound (/eɪ/) that is not typical, although it is consistent with its own description ('long I sound' - interpreted as /aɪ/ or /eɪ/ followed by 'tamin'). More significantly, its final summary of the primary difference explicitly states 'the vowel sound of the first syllable and the syllable stress'. This contradicts its own examples which showed stress on the first syllable for *both* British and American versions according to Audio 2's delivery.

Comparing the two based on how well they executed and described the requested paralinguistic features: Audio 1 correctly identifies the typical paralinguistic differences (stress shift, vowel changes, T sound) and attempts to describe them, even if the vowel execution was imperfect. Audio 2 has a better British execution but its American execution is less standard and its description of the stress difference is inconsistent with its own examples. Therefore, Audio 1 is better at describing the requested paralinguistic features.",loss,1,"The user asked for the word 'vitamin' to be pronounced in British and American accents and for the differences in stress and vowels to be described. I evaluated the audio outputs solely on their paralinguistic features, specifically focusing on the accuracy of the demonstrated accents, stress, and vowel sounds, and the paralinguistic delivery of the description.

Audio 1 provides plausible pronunciations for both British ('vit-a-min' with stress on the first syllable and a short 'i') and American ('vi-ta-min' with stress on the first syllable and a long 'i'). While stating stress is on the first syllable for both might be a simplification for some American pronunciations, the vowel difference (short 'i' vs. long 'i') is a primary paralinguistic distinction and is accurately demonstrated and described.

Audio 2 attempts the accents but the execution is flawed. The British pronunciation sounds closer to the American 'long i' than a typical British short 'i'. The American pronunciation incorrectly places stress on the second syllable ('vi-TA-min'). The descriptions of vowel sounds are confusing and inaccurate ('vowel sound in E'). The description of stress placement is incorrect for standard American. While Audio 2 attempts more detailed phonetic description (like the 'T' sound and 'slight D sound'), the inaccuracies in the core accent pronunciations and descriptions of stress and vowels make its paralinguistic execution significantly weaker.

Overall, Audio 1 successfully demonstrates key paralinguistic differences in the requested accents, whereas Audio 2 fails to accurately execute the core accent pronunciations and provides incorrect descriptions."

While the specific sounds it produces ('siv', 'ik') may not be the correct reversal ('ic', 'civ'), it *does* attempt to perform the core paralinguistic instruction of breaking the sound down and enunciating segments, using deliberate pacing and pauses to highlight these units. The enunciation of the sounds it produces is relatively clear.

Audio 2 attempts to pronounce the word 'civic' spelled backward ('civic'), pronouncing it as a single word 'Icvic'. It does *not* break the word down into syllables ('ic-civ') or clearly enunciate *each syllable* of the backward form. It ignores the 'each syllable' part of the instruction entirely, treating it as a single unit pronunciation.

Focusing purely on the paralinguistic execution of the instruction, Audio 1 is superior because it actually attempts the requested paralinguistic behaviour (breaking into syllables and enunciating them clearly) in the second part, even if the specific lexical content of those syllables is questionable based on the instruction. Audio 2 fails to perform the requested paralinguistic behaviour of syllabic breakdown and enunciation."

The disruptions are pervasive throughout the requested phrase.

While these are 'audio glitches,' they don't convey the sense of the *voice* itself malfunctioning as effectively as Audio 1's approach of vocally disrupting the speech flow.

Audio 1 begins to spell ('C', 'O', 'U') but stops prematurely and completely fails to apply any emphasis to the 'O' or 'U' sounds. Audio 2 fails to spell the word at all. Instead, it pronounces the word ('Comoatapuer') and attempts to apply emphasis to the 'O' and 'U' sounds within that pronunciation. While Audio 2 applies the emphasis in the incorrect context (pronunciation instead of spelling), it at least attempts the core requested paralinguistic feature (vowel emphasis).

This task is highly difficult for current TTS technology and is interpreted as attempting to produce the sounds of the original sentence played backwards. Audio 1 attempts this by producing a sound stream that, while distorted, resembles an attempt to play the original speech sounds in reverse. Audio 2 also attempts this but its output sounds more fragmented and less like a continuous reversed sound stream compared to Audio 1. Therefore, Audio 1's execution of the challenging reversed pronunciation task is paralinguistically superior as it makes a more coherent attempt to produce the requested sound pattern.",loss,1,"The user requested two things: recite a sentence normally and then pronounce the *entire sentence* in reverse order. Audio 1 correctly recites the sentence and then attempts to pronounce the sounds of the *entire sentence* backwards, which is a specific paralinguistic performance task requiring altered rhythm and sound flow. Audio 2 recites the sentence and then simply recites the *words* of the sentence in reverse order, using normal pronunciation for each word. Audio 2 failed to execute the instruction to pronounce the *entire sentence* in reverse order (implying reversing the sound stream), whereas Audio 1 attempted this specific paralinguistic manipulation. Therefore, Audio 1 is better at executing the requested paralinguistic task."

Audio 2 completely misinterprets the instruction, saying 'Whistle good morning, have a great day.' It fails to whistle and fails to speak the phrase correctly in sequence. Its spoken output appears to be an attempt to combine the whistle instruction with the phrase content, resulting in a nonsensical spoken utterance that does not match the requested paralinguistic output sequence or phrase.

I am evaluating based purely on paralinguistic features: tone, prosody, expressiveness, and accent/pronunciation, especially the demonstration of the requested accents and stress patterns. 

Audio 1 attempts both accents but struggles significantly with the British pronunciation, which sounds closer to the American version. While its description of the stress change location (2nd vs 1st syllable) is correct, its actual spoken examples don't clearly demonstrate this difference due to the inaccurate British accent.

Audio 2 provides much clearer and more authentic-sounding demonstrations of both the British ('adVERtisement' - stress on 2nd) and American ('ADvertisement' - stress on 1st) accents. It uses prosody well to emphasize the stressed syllables in the examples. Although its *description* states the American stress is on the third syllable (which is incorrect), its *actual pronunciation* places the stress correctly on the first. 

Since the core paralinguistic task involves demonstrating the different accents and stress patterns through speech, Audio 2's superior execution of the pronunciation examples outweighs the minor error in its verbal description of the American stress location. Audio 1's failure to produce a convincing British accent and stress demonstration makes its paralinguistic performance weaker.",loss,1,"The user requested the word 'advertisement' to be spoken first in a British accent and then an American accent, describing how the stress changes.

Audio 1 successfully demonstrates a plausible British pronunciation with stress on the second syllable ('advertisement') and a plausible American pronunciation with stress on the third syllable ('advertisement'). It explicitly states where the stress falls in each case. The prosody and emphasis effectively highlight these differences.

Audio 2 attempts the accents but the execution is less convincing than Audio 1. Crucially, while it correctly identifies the British stress on the second syllable, it incorrectly states and attempts to demonstrate the American stress on the first syllable. Standard American pronunciation typically places stress on the third syllable, or sometimes the second. This factual error regarding the paralinguistic feature (stress placement) makes Audio 2's demonstration inaccurate and less effective compared to Audio 1, which correctly demonstrates the common stress patterns."

Audio 2 also recites the sentence initially (though it skips this in the provided clip and jumps straight to the reverse part), but for the reverse part, it pronounces the *content* of the sentence in reversed word order ('I'm Adam in Eden') using standard forward pronunciation. It completely misses the paralinguistic task of reversing the speech sounds themselves. Audio 1 directly addresses the paralinguistic challenge of reverse pronunciation, while Audio 2 does not. Therefore, Audio 1 is superior in its execution of the requested paralinguistic features."

Audio 2 skipped the initial sequential pronunciation but proceeded to explain each tone individually, including the neutral tone. Crucially, Audio 2's production of the individual Mandarin tones (first, second, third, fourth, and neutral) was significantly more accurate and distinct compared to Audio 1.

Audio 2 says 'level' normally (also preceded by irrelevant text) but completely fails to pronounce the word backwards. Instead, it describes how the word is pronounced, how it's spelled backwards, and then repeatedly reads out phonetic/linguistic notation ('/slash stress level slash/ level') while discussing reversing the sound or syllables. This is not a demonstration of the reversed sound itself, but rather reading lexical content describing the task. Furthermore, Audio 2's endless repetition of the notation makes its prosody extremely poor and monotonous. Audio 1, despite its own flaws (extra text, imperfect reversal), directly attempts the core paralinguistic task requested, whereas Audio 2 avoids it entirely and devolves into repetitive, irrelevant description. Therefore, Audio 1 is significantly better in terms of paralinguistic execution relative to the instruction."

I am evaluating the paralinguistic features, specifically the quality of the sound mimicry and the adherence to the repetition structure.

Audio 1 presents the sequence 'neigh, neigh, roar, roar, chirp, chirp'. The vocalizations sound like human attempts to mimic the animal sounds. The 'neigh' is a somewhat passable imitation, the 'roar' is a poor, strained imitation, and the 'chirp' is simply the word 'chirp' spoken, not a mimicry of the sound. However, it correctly follows the instruction to repeat each sound twice.

Audio 2 presents the sequence 'neigh, nay, rar, rar, chirp, chirp, neigh, nay, rar, rar, chirp, chirp'. It repeats the entire sequence twice, which was not requested. The vocalizations sound mostly like a human saying the words 'neigh', 'roar' (transcribed as 'rar'), and 'chirp', rather than attempting to mimic the actual sounds. The 'neigh' and 'roar' sound more like the words themselves than imitations of the animal vocalizations, and the 'chirp' is clearly just the word.

Comparing the two based on paralinguistic features: Both fail to produce convincing animal sound mimicry. Audio 1's attempts at the 'neigh' and 'roar', while poor, are slightly more in the spirit of attempting the *sound* rather than saying the *word* compared to Audio 2. Crucially, Audio 1 correctly follows the repetition instruction, whereas Audio 2 repeats the entire sequence incorrectly. Therefore, Audio 1 is slightly better in terms of following the structural instruction and making a slightly more credible (though still weak) attempt at mimicking the requested sounds.",loss,1,"The user requested the audio outputs to mimic specific animal sounds. Audio 1 attempts to mimic the sounds of a horse neighing, a lion roaring, and a bird chirping using vocalizations that somewhat resemble these sounds.

Audio 1 also completes the full sequence as requested, whereas Audio 2 is cut off. Therefore, Audio 1 is significantly better at performing the requested paralinguistic mimicry."

The overall flow sounds genuinely native-like.

Audio 2 also attempts the Singaporean accent and uses Singlish particles like 'lah' and 'right', but the execution is less successful.

Audio 1 attempts a British accent, pronouncing 'advertisement' with stress on the third syllable ('advertisement'), which is a common British pronunciation.

Both outputs contained linguistic inaccuracies regarding the typical sounds of 'C' in these languages (e.g., French 'c' before i/e is usually S, not TS or soft S/Z like in 'measure'; Brazilian Portuguese 'c' before i/e is usually S/Z, not TS).

Audio 2 successfully demonstrates the British pronunciation ('VItamin' with stress on the first syllable and a short 'i') and the American pronunciation ('VY-tə-min' with stress on the first syllable and a long 'i'). Its description of the differences correctly identifies the primary difference as being in the first vowel sound and the syllable stress, and accurately states where the stress lies in each accent (first syllable for both, but emphasizing the differing vowel sound linked to that stress).

The speaker's tone and prosody are appropriate for explaining these differences. Audio 2 attempts to demonstrate the accents but incorrectly places the stress on the second syllable for both British and American examples. The descriptions of the vowel sounds and stress in Audio 2 also do not align with standard pronunciations or common linguistic analysis for this word.

Audio 2 also attempts a soft and relaxing voice, and at times sounds slightly more natural than Audio 1, but it is less consistently soft and relaxing throughout the entire clip; there are moments where the delivery feels more neutral or slightly more energetic than requested. Because the instruction specifically emphasized the style 'throughout', Audio 1's consistent execution of the requested soft and relaxing tone makes it better at following the specific paralinguistic instruction, despite being less varied in its expressiveness."

While the segmentation and the target of the emphasis (the added segment, not specifically the 'last three letters') don't perfectly match a strict interpretation of 'last three letters each time' based on cumulative segments, it clearly and effectively demonstrates the requested paralinguistic feature of 'increasing emphasis each time' the word is expanded upon.

The second recitation is quick and delivered well. Audio 2's first recitation is delivered slowly but naturally, with appropriate pacing for a slow sentence. The second recitation is delivered quickly and naturally. Audio 2 adheres better to the paralinguistic instruction by delivering both the slow and quick versions with natural prosody, effectively showcasing the requested speed variation. Audio 1's unnatural pacing in the 'slow' section is a significant paralinguistic weakness.",loss,1,"The user requested the tongue twister to be recited twice: once slowly and once very quickly. I am evaluating based solely on paralinguistic features, specifically how the instruction to change pacing was executed.

Audio 1 recites the tongue twister relatively slowly the first time, maintaining natural prosody for slower speech. It then recites it much faster the second time, demonstrating the requested contrast in pacing effectively. The pacing clearly distinguishes the two required versions.

Audio 2 attempts the 'slow' version by breaking the tongue twister into individual words with significant pauses between each word. While this is technically slow, it deviates from a typical recitation of a phrase and feels unnatural. It then recites the tongue twister quickly (and repeats it). The contrast in pacing is present, but the execution of the 'slow' speed through excessive segmentation is less aligned with reciting the phrase 'slowly'.

Audio 1's execution of the pacing changes is more natural and fits the context of reciting a tongue twister."

This directly addresses the paralinguistic requirement to show whether the 'H' is pronounced in each accent. Audio 2, however, fails to pronounce 'herb' with the 'H' sound in the British accent demonstration, even though its accompanying text describes it as having the 'H'. It correctly omits the 'H' in the American pronunciation. Therefore, Audio 1 is significantly better at executing the requested paralinguistic distinction through pronunciation.",tie,tie,"The user requested the word 'herb' be pronounced in both British and American accents, specifically highlighting the pronunciation (or lack thereof) of the 'H'.

Audio 1: The voice adopts a clear, informative tone. Prosody is steady and appropriate. Expressiveness is low, which is fine for this task. For the British pronunciation, the speaker *states* the 'H' is pronounced but the actual audio output of 'herb' sounds like 'erb', with no discernible 'H'. For the American pronunciation, the speaker states the 'H' is silent and the audio correctly produces 'erb'. The key paralinguistic failure is the mismatch between the stated British pronunciation and the actual audio demonstration.

Audio 2: The voice also uses a clear, informative tone with steady prosody and low expressiveness. For the British pronunciation, the speaker states the 'H' is pronounced as a 'soft H' and even provides phonetic notation implying an 'H' sound. However, the actual audio output clearly sounds like 'erb', without any 'H' sound. For the American pronunciation, the speaker states the 'H' is not pronounced and correctly produces 'erb'. Like Audio 1, the paralinguistic failure is the contradiction between the claimed British pronunciation (with an 'H') and the actual audio output (without an 'H'). Audio 2 is slightly more detailed in its incorrect explanation ('soft H', phonetic notation), making the mismatch potentially more confusing.

Both audios correctly identify the American pronunciation but fail to accurately or successfully demonstrate the typical British pronunciation of 'herb' (which often omits the 'H') while *claiming* the 'H' is present. Neither successfully uses paralinguistics (the actual sound produced) to highlight the British 'H' sound they described. Because both exhibit a fundamental flaw in demonstrating the core paralinguistic distinction requested for the British example, and their overall paralinguistic delivery is otherwise comparable, they are equally poor."
72,"Teach me an example of Thai language tones using the word 'ma' in different tones.

The core paralinguistic requirement was the accurate execution and differentiation of the Thai tones.

Audio 1 did not perform the initial 'all tones in one go' demonstration. It proceeded directly to explaining each tone individually. More significantly, its execution of the tones for 'ma' was largely incorrect relative to the standard Thai tones being named (e.g., pronouncing a falling tone for 'low tone', a rising tone for 'high tone', a falling tone for 'rising tone', and a low tone for 'falling tone'). While it explained all five tones, the paralinguistic examples provided were inaccurate.

Audio 2 attempted the initial 'all tones in one go' demonstration, though the tones were not clearly distinguishable or accurate. It then proceeded to explain each tone, but it only explained four of the five tones, omitting the falling tone entirely from the explanation segment. Its individual tone pronunciations were also not consistently clear or accurate representations of the Thai tones.

Both audios failed significantly at the core paralinguistic task: accurately demonstrating the Thai tones. However, Audio 1, despite getting the specific tone pronunciations wrong, did at least attempt to explain and provide an example (however flawed) for all five standard Thai tones. Audio 2 failed to even cover all five tones in its explanation. While Audio 2 followed the structural request to demonstrate 'all in one go' first (though poorly), Audio 1's more complete coverage of the topic by including all five tones in the explanation makes its paralinguistic demonstration slightly better overall in terms of scope, despite the accuracy issues common to both.",win,2,"The user requested a demonstration and explanation of Thai language tones using the word 'ma'. The evaluation focuses exclusively on paralinguistic features, specifically how well the tones and other vocal qualities were executed. Audio 1 attempted to demonstrate the five tones in one go first, as requested, but the execution of the tones themselves was inaccurate and inconsistent. The subsequent individual tone demonstrations during the explanation were also poor. Audio 2 did not demonstrate the tones all in one go before explaining. However, Audio 2's individual demonstrations of each tone during the explanation section were significantly more accurate in terms of pitch contour (mid, low, high, rising, falling) compared to Audio 1. Although Audio 2 missed one part of the structural instruction, its paralinguistic execution of the core task – demonstrating the specific Thai tones – was much better and clearer than Audio 1. Therefore, based purely on the quality of the paralinguistic output (the accuracy of the tones demonstrated), Audio 2 is superior."

Audio 1 breaks down the reversed character order (DNAHAIHT) by pronouncing each letter individually, providing clarifying examples ('D as in day', etc.). While this isn't strictly 'syllables' of the reversed string, it is a very clear and segmented pronunciation of the reversed characters, reflecting the task's core requirement of reversing the order. The prosody is clear and the pacing is deliberate during this segmentation. It then attempts to pronounce the full reversed string as a 'whole word'. Audio 2 attempts a syllable-by-syllable pronunciation ('t', 'land', 'yat') and a whole word ('Nanyad') that do not seem to accurately reflect the reverse character order (DNAHAIHT) of 'Thailand'. The segmentation in Audio 2 is also less clear and the overall prosody is more halting.

Both models struggled significantly with this complex instruction regarding paralinguistic execution. Audio 1 attempted to pronounce segments ('tland', 'yacht') and then a combined word ('Nanyad'). Its interpretation of 'reverse character order' and 'syllable' seems incorrect, but it did attempt to produce distinct sound segments and a final word-like sound. Audio 2 correctly identified the reverse character order (DNALIHT) but then interpreted 'pronouncing each syllable separately' as pronouncing each *letter* separately, often using example words (D as in day, etc.). It then pronounced the sequence of letters 'DNALIHT' as a whole word. Neither model successfully pronounced the *syllables* of the reversed word separately and then together. However, Audio 1's attempt to pronounce sound chunks (even if incorrect) and a final word-like sound is slightly closer to the concept of working with syllables/sounds than Audio 2's clear misinterpretation of 'syllable' as 'letter' and simply reading the reversed letters."

Audio 1 delivers the description with a consistently slow pace and a gentle, relatively flat intonation that effectively creates a soothing and calming atmosphere throughout the passage. It maintains the requested tone and pacing consistently.

Audio 2, while starting softly, varies its pacing significantly throughout the longer description. It also introduces more expressive elements and character voices (which are part of the narrative, not the requested descriptive tone) and includes background sound effects (which are not paralinguistic features of the voice itself). The variability in pacing and expressiveness in Audio 2 detracts from the consistently slow and soothing tone and calming mood specifically requested for the description.

Focusing purely on the paralinguistic execution of the requested 'slow and soothing tone' and 'calming mood' for the descriptive voice, Audio 1 adheres much more closely to the instruction."
