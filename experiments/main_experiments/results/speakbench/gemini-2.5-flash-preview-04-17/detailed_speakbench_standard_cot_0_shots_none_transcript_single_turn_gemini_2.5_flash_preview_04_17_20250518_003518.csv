Both models correctly identified the Morse code sequence for 'Code is fun'. However, both models failed to implement the primary paralinguistic instruction: they did not use actual alternating short and long syllables in their speech. Instead, both models interpreted the instruction as listing the words 'long' and 'short' to describe the length of the corresponding Morse code element (dash='long', dot='short'). Neither made the words 'long' or 'short' sound long or short, nor did they make their syllables alternate in length in the audio output. This is a significant shared failure. 

Comparing them based on the accuracy of the sequence of 'long' and 'short' words they spoke (their misinterpretation): both models made identical errors in the sequences for 'C' and 'O', incorrectly stating 'Long short long long' for C (-.-.) which should be 'Long short long short', and 'Short long long short' for O (---) which should be 'Long long long'. For 'D' (-..), Audio 1 said 'Short long' (should be 'Long short short'), while Audio 2 said 'Long short short short' (should be 'Long short short'). Audio 1 missed two elements in the D sequence, while Audio 2 added one element. When counting individual word errors compared to the correct 'long'/'short' sequence, Audio 1 had 5 errors, and Audio 2 had 4 errors. 

Although both failed the main instruction in the same way, Audio 2 was slightly more accurate in the sequence of words it chose to speak, resulting in fewer individual word errors based on their shared incorrect interpretation. Therefore, Audio 2 is marginally better."

Audio 2 repeats the phrase but critically fails to actually perform the requested tones and pitch changes. Instead, it verbalizes descriptions of the tones and pitch changes ('slight increase in pitch as if surprised', 'lower pitch, as if skeptical', 'high pitch as if overjoyed') without genuinely sounding that way.

Audio 2 spells out the phrase letter by letter, slowly and clearly, which is a more standard interpretation of 'spell out'. Crucially, Audio 2 increases the emphasis on the final individual letters (G, Y) as it progresses through the spelling, directly addressing the instruction to increase emphasis on the 'last three letters' (even if it only applies to the last two letters with noticeable effect in this specific example, it's closer than Audio 1's approach).

It says 'AI technology' then attempts spellings like 'A I T E C H - dash knowledge' before finally producing a correct spelling 'A I T E C H N O L O G Y'. Crucially, in this final correct spelling, it does place increased emphasis on the 'O', 'G', and 'Y' compared to its prior attempts. While its semantic execution is flawed due to the incorrect attempts, it is the only audio that engages with the core paralinguistic instruction of repeating the spelling and increasing emphasis 'each time'.

Therefore, Audio 2 follows the instruction better by attempting the repetition and increasing emphasis, even if its semantic accuracy is poor initially. Audio 1 is semantically accurate in its single spelling but fails the paralinguistic core of the instruction."

Audio 1 interpreted this as attempting to pronounce the phrase with the letters reversed, sounding out segments based on that (e.g., 'A', 'nam', 'a', 'nal'). While not a syllable reversal, it is an attempt to reverse the content of the original phrase. Audio 2 produced a sequence of seemingly unrelated words ('Monapa', 'La California', 'na', 'plana', 'mana') which bear no discernible relationship to the original phrase, either reversed by syllable or letter.

Both models fail significantly on the second part of the instruction. However, the instruction asked for 'pronunciation' of syllables. Audio 1 attempts something resembling pronunciation and syllabic separation, albeit of the wrong word/syllables. Audio 2 performs a different task entirely (spelling).

When it attempts the syllabic representation, it describes the sounds verbally ('long short', 'long long', etc.) as it performs them, which is counter to generating the sounds directly. Furthermore, the sequence of sounds it generates ('long short, long long, short long long short, short long') does not match the correct Morse code for 'CODE IS FUN' (- . - . / . . / . . - .). The execution is also slow and not clearly defined short/long syllables.

Audio 2 correctly identifies the phrase. It directly provides the Morse code representation using alternating syllables ('da' for dash, 'dit' for dot) without first stating the standard verbal representation. The sequence of sounds ('da dit da dit, dit dit, dit dit da dit') perfectly matches the Morse code for 'CODE IS FUN' (- . - . / . . / . . - .), using 'da' as the long syllable and 'dit' as the short syllable in an alternating pattern (da=long, dit=short, da=long, dit=short, dit=short, dit=short, dit=short, dit=short, da=long, dit=short - effectively using 'da' for dash and 'dit' for dot as alternating sounds). The paralinguistics are clear and the execution of the sounds is effective.

Audio 2 says the sentence three times, but crucially, it prefaces each delivery by explicitly stating which tone it is using ('said in a happy tone', 'said sarcastically', 'said with annoyance'). The instruction was to *say* the sentence *in* the tone, not to *describe* the tone before saying the sentence. Furthermore, while it attempts the tones, the actual paralinguistic execution in Audio 2 is less convincing than in Audio 1.

Audio 2 starts with something that sounds like a reversed word, but it's not 'racecar' and is unclear. It then includes conversational filler ('What would it be?'). It proceeds to say 'racecar' normally, fulfilling the first part of the instruction. However, its attempt to say 'racecar' reversed is unclear and sounds like 'racsecar' or similar, failing to maintain clarity and recognizable pronunciation of the reversed word.

Audio 1 understands the nature of the word 'racecar' and its reversal property, communicating this clearly and correctly. Audio 2 attempts the pronunciation of the reversed word but does so poorly, with errors and lack of clarity, and includes irrelevant filler. Therefore, Audio 1 is better because it provides a correct and clear response based on the specific word given, even if it interprets 'reverse it' as explaining the palindrome property rather than strictly attempting a phonetic reversal (which would be redundant for a palindrome). Audio 2 actively fails at the attempt it makes."

The tone-meaning mapping provided (Middle=come, High=horse, Rising=dog, Low=come imperative) is partially correct but inconsistent and incomplete regarding the standard 5 tones and their typical 'ma' meanings. The paralinguistic execution of the tones is not perfect.

Audio 2 also introduces the concept and attempts to demonstrate five tones, although it uses 'asterisk ma asterisk' which sounds like placeholder text instead of the actual word 'ma'. It then proceeds to explain all five tones individually, providing a tone label (High, Low, Falling, Mid, Rising) and a meaning (horse, come, mother, dog, particle). These meanings are largely consistent with standard Thai 'ma' meanings for the five tones. However, the verbal descriptions of the pitch contours for some tones (e.g., describing the High tone pronunciation as starting middle and rising, which describes a Rising tone) contradict the tone labels it gives. The paralinguistic execution of the tones is also not ideal.

Comparing the two, Audio 1 fundamentally fails to explain all 5 tones as requested, only explaining 4. Audio 2, despite using a placeholder word and having some contradictions in its pitch contour descriptions, does cover all 5 tones and provides generally correct meanings for each.

Since the voice characteristic is arguably more central to the instruction than the poorly executed pitch change attempt in Audio 1, Audio 2 is considered better overall.",loss,1,"The user requested a countdown from 10 to 1 using a robotic or alien-like voice, with the added instruction to gradually change the pitch and tone. Both audio outputs successfully performed the countdown and utilized a robotic or artificial-sounding voice. However, neither audio effectively implemented the instruction to gradually change the pitch and tone during the countdown sequence (10-1). Audio 1 maintained a very flat pitch during the numbers, while Audio 2 had a repetitive slight inflection on each number, neither constituting a 'gradual change' across the range. Comparing the voice styles, Audio 1's delivery during the numbers felt slightly more consistently robotic than Audio 2's, which had a bit more variation that leaned away from the purely robotic feel. Since both failed on the pitch change element, the slight edge goes to Audio 1 for its slightly better execution of the requested voice style for the core counting task."

Audio 1 successfully produces the three distinct animal sounds in the correct sequence (moo, hiss, howl). The quality of the sounds is decent. However, the final wolf howl is held for only about 2 seconds, not the requested 5 seconds.

Audio 2 does not produce actual animal sounds. It sounds like a human vocalizing or describing the sounds ('moo hissing a wool'). This fails the primary semantic request of producing the sounds themselves. While it does hold the final vocalization, it's not a wolf howl and the duration is also only about 2-3 seconds, failing the 5-second requirement just like Audio 1.

Audio 2 also pronounces the word in both contexts and explains the difference. However, it includes a confusing and poorly formatted phonetic transcription which is not helpful for an audio response. While it correctly identifies the main sound difference, its verbal explanation is slightly less clear than Audio 1, and the accent performance is less convincing and distinct compared to Audio 1.

Overall, Audio 1 is better because its explanation is clearer and delivered more naturally, and the accent differentiation is more effective."

Audio 1 provided a lengthy explanation of the process and then attempted to translate individual letters ('A', 'I', 'S', 'C', 'O', 'O', 'L'), missing the word 'is'. The final vocalization provided ('eee') does not represent the Morse code for 'AI is cool' or even the individual letters it attempted earlier. The vocal sounds for dots and dashes were not clearly distinguishable or used correctly.

Audio 2 stated it would provide the Morse code using short and long vocal sounds but then proceeded to *verbalize* the symbols ('dot', 'asteric', 'I', 'S') rather than purely using vocal sounds to represent the dots and dashes. It also only got partially through the phrase and the final sound was a continuous tone.

Both audios failed significantly. Audio 1 failed to correctly translate the phrase and provided a nonsensical final output.

Audio 2 stated that it would perform the task using 'long sounds to represent dots and dashes', which is a contradictory statement regarding short/long representation. However, it then proceeded to attempt to produce vocal sound sequences for each letter. While the sounds produced and the stated rule were inconsistent and often incorrect for the specific letters (e.g., only a single long sound for 'A' or 'I', incorrect sequence for 'L'), it did make an effort to generate the requested output type (vocal Morse code sequence) for most letters, differentiating between short and long sounds in its attempt (even if it described the rule incorrectly). It also failed to output the final concatenated sequence correctly.

Comparing the two, Audio 1 completely failed to produce the requested output format (vocal Morse code sequence). Audio 2, despite significant semantic errors in translation and description, attempted the requested format and produced sequences of vocal sounds that were closer to the requirement than Audio 1's output. Therefore, Audio 2 is better because it at least partially attempted the core task of generating vocal Morse code sequences, whereas Audio 1 did not."

However, its 'syllable pronunciation' ('Dolanahti') seems to be an attempt to sound out the reversed letters, not the reversed syllables of 'Thailand'. Crucially, for the 'whole word pronunciation', it pronounces 'Thailand', the original word, not the reversed one. This response significantly misunderstands the pronunciation steps.

Audio 2 also correctly states the word 'Thailand'.

Audio 2 provides conversational filler explaining the task, then attempts to pronounce what it claims are the separate syllables of the reversed word ('t land yat'), and then the whole reversed word ('Nan yad'). The sounds produced ('t land yat', 'Nan yad') do not correspond to the reversed characters of 'Thailand' ('dnaliahT'), and the syllable breakdown seems arbitrary. However, Audio 2 does attempt the structure requested: separate parts followed by the whole word, and at least engages with the concept of reversing the word, even if it fails completely at the execution of the sounds and adds unnecessary descriptive text.

While neither audio correctly performs the task, Audio 2 is slightly better because it attempts the core structure and concept of the instruction (reversing, separate parts, whole word), whereas Audio 1 ignores the main part of the instruction entirely. Audio 2's failure is in execution and adding filler, while Audio 1's failure is in complete omission of the core task.",loss,1,"The user asked for the word 'Thailand' to be said in reverse character order, pronouncing each syllable separately and then as a whole word. Audio 1 interpreted 'in reverse character order' in a way that resulted in sounds/syllables like 'land, yat' and then 'nan-yad' as a whole word. While the exact mapping to 'reverse character order' of 'Thailand' is questionable ('dnaliahT'), Audio 1 *did* follow the subsequent instructions to pronounce the reversed form syllable by syllable and as a whole word. Audio 2 correctly stated the word 'Thailand' and then the reversed character string 'dnaliahT', but failed completely to follow the instructions to pronounce the syllables separately and then the whole word 'dnaliahT'. Because Audio 1 attempted and completed the core pronunciation task requested for the reversed form (even if its interpretation of the reversed form itself was unusual), it is better than Audio 2 which only stated the reversed string and did not perform the pronunciation task at all."

Audio 2 delivers the sentence three times, explicitly stating 'In a happy tone...', 'In a sarcastic tone...', 'In an annoyed tone...' before each delivery. However, the actual performance of the tones in Audio 2 is weaker; the 'happy' tone sounds neutral, and the 'sarcastic' and 'annoyed' tones are only mildly expressed. The instruction emphasizes not favoring verbal descriptions over actual tonal expression. Audio 1, while not explicitly labeling the tones or including a clearly 'happy' one, does a better job of demonstrating *different* emotional deliveries through performance, aligning better with the paralinguistic requirement to focus on expression.

Pronouncing the 'entire sentence in reverse order' means reversing the word order, resulting in 'Adam, I'm Eden, in Madam'.

Audio 1 does not recite the original sentence. It immediately says 'The sentence in reverse order is, I'm Adam in Eden'. This is incorrect on two counts: it didn't say the original sentence first, and 'I'm Adam in Eden' is not the reverse word order of the entire sentence 'Madam, in Eden, I'm Adam'.

Audio 2 correctly recites the original sentence: 'Madam, in Eden, I'm Adam'. It then attempts the second part, saying 'Now, in reverse order,' but proceeds to pronounce the letters of the sentence in reverse order (e.g., 'Nad a aim...'). This is a misinterpretation of the instruction 'pronounce the entire sentence in reverse order', which typically means reversing the word order. However, it did perform the first part of the instruction correctly.

Comparing the two, Audio 2 correctly performs the first step, while Audio 1 skips it. Both fail the second step, but Audio 2's attempt, while incorrect (reversing letters instead of words), is a more direct attempt to reverse the sentence's content than Audio 1's output, which doesn't match the correct word reversal or a letter reversal of the original sentence.

Audio 1 produces the sequence horse, lion, bird, repeating each sound twice. However, the 'mimicry' is poor; the sounds are more like spoken words or simple vocalizations ('Nayz nayz', 'Ruow zer ruow zer', 'chirp chirp') rather than attempts at genuine animal sounds. The delivery is flat.

Audio 2 also produces the sequence horse, lion, bird initially. It repeats each sound twice within this sequence ('Nay nay', 'Rarr rarr', 'chirp chirp'). Crucially, it then repeats the entire sequence (horse, lion, bird, each sound twice) a second time, which was not requested. The mimicry in Audio 2 is slightly better than Audio 1, sounding more like actual attempts to mimic the animal noises, particularly the neighing and roaring, although still far from realistic.

Audio 1 followed the requested structure (sequence and repetition count) but failed significantly on the quality of mimicry. Audio 2 failed on the structure by repeating the entire sequence but performed marginally better on the quality of mimicry.

Audio 2 produced the sequence: Neigh, Neigh, Roar, Roar, Chirp, Chirp. It stopped after completing the sequence once. The vocal mimicry for the neigh and chirp were clearer than Audio 1's, and the roar, while still a vocal imitation, was slightly better.

It sounds like a casual conversation about the weather. Audio 2 also uses extensive Singlish ('Ah lah', 'right?', 'lah', 'you know', 'it's like', 'easy'), but the language feels slightly more structured and explanatory, covering topics like tropical rainforest climate, specific temperatures, humidity, haze, and even tangents like beaches and food. While Audio 2 is comprehensive in its content about Singapore, Audio 1 feels marginally more authentic and conversational in its application of Singlish specifically to the topic of weather, aligning slightly better with the 'like a native Singaporean person' persona in a casual context. Both are high quality, but Audio 1 edges out due to slightly more natural-sounding colloquial Singlish specific to the weather topic."

Audio 1 pronounces the word in a way that sounds like the second-syllable stress for British English, but states the stress is on the third syllable. For American English, it pronounces the word with stress on the third syllable and initially states the stress is on the third, then mentions it might be on the first syllable in some American accents.

This directly addresses the 'stuttering' aspect of the request. Audio 2 also uses a broken, somewhat robotic effect, but the stuttering is less pronounced and consistent, often relying more on pauses or single-syllable repetitions rather than multi-syllable initial sound repetitions. Audio 1's interpretation of 'stuttering' is closer to the typical understanding of that effect when applied robotically.",win,2,"The user requested the sentence 'Good evening, how was your day?' spoken with a 'broken, robotic, stuttering effect'. Both audio samples speak the correct sentence. Audio 1 has a stuttering effect with some repetition and unnatural pauses. Audio 2 uses repeated letters before words (e.g., 'ggg good', 'eee evening', 'hhh how', 'www was', 'yyy your', 'ddd day'), which creates a very distinct, digital, and artificial-sounding stuttering effect. This effect in Audio 2 aligns more closely with the description 'broken, robotic, stuttering' than the effect in Audio 1."

The skeptical tone has a lower pitch, the surprised tone has a rising pitch, and the overjoyed tone is high-pitched and expressive. Audio 2 simply says the phrase once with a rising intonation that could be interpreted as surprised or questioning.

Audio 2 repeats the phrase multiple times, explicitly stating which tone it is attempting ('skeptical tone', 'surprised tone', 'overjoyed tone') before attempting to voice the phrase in that tone. While the explicit commentary is not requested and is a drawback, Audio 2 does make more noticeable attempts at changing the tone and pitch to reflect the requested emotions (e.g., a low skeptical tone, a higher surprised tone, a high-pitched overjoyed tone, albeit with added sound effects like squeals and giggles). Although Audio 2 has significant flaws with the commentary and extraneous sounds, it demonstrates a much clearer attempt at fulfilling the core paralinguistic requirements of changing tone and pitch according to the requested emotions compared to Audio 1, which essentially ignores this part of the instruction."

It translates individual letters incorrectly and combines them into a sequence that does not represent 'code is fun' in Morse. The resulting sequence of sounds is also presented somewhat awkwardly. Audio 2 correctly translates the phrase 'CODE IS FUN' (a reasonable interpretation of the input given typical phrase capitalization) into its standard Morse code sequence. It then uses 'long' syllables for dashes and 'short' syllables for dots and vocalizes the entire sequence accurately.

Audio 1 provides an incorrect Morse code translation for the phrase. It also attempts to describe the resulting sequence using syllables, but the underlying Morse is wrong, making the entire output semantically incorrect. The paralinguistic attempt to represent the code with syllables is unclear and based on incorrect information.

Audio 2 correctly breaks down the phrase and provides the correct Morse code translation for each letter/word. It correctly identifies how the alternating short and long syllables would map to the dots and dashes for each word. While it describes the syllables rather than purely *performing* the full sequence paralinguistically, it demonstrates a clear understanding of the requested semantic translation and the specific paralinguistic mapping rule. It vocalizes the syllable sequence for each word it translates.

Audio 2 is superior because it gets the fundamental semantic translation correct and accurately applies the requested paralinguistic rule to the translation, even if the final execution is more descriptive than performative of the full sequence."

In terms of semantics, both fulfill the core request, although Audio 2 is more developed. In terms of paralinguistics, Audio 2 is significantly better. It maintains a consistently slow, soft, and genuinely soothing tone throughout. The pacing is deliberate, and the voice is smooth. Audio 1's voice, while attempting a slow pace, has moments of breathiness or a slightly less smooth quality and doesn't feel as consistently soothing or calming as Audio 2. Audio 2's excellent execution of the requested tone and mood makes it the better response."
75,Talk about different regions in India. You must speak in a thick Indian accent like a native Indian person.,asr+llama3+tts,audio_data/speakbench_judge_audio/75/asr+llama3+tts.wav,audio_data/speakbench_judge_audio/75/gpt4o-audio.wav,win,1,"Both audio clips discuss different regions of India, fulfilling the semantic requirement. The core difference lies in the paralinguistics, specifically the requested 'thick Indian accent like a native Indian person'. Both models attempt this accent, and both sound somewhat performative or stereotypical rather than naturally native. However, Audio 1's accent feels noticeably thicker and more pronounced than Audio 2. Audio 1 also incorporates Hindi interjections like 'Namaste' and 'beta', which adds to the requested 'native' feel, even if it leans into a stereotypical portrayal. Audio 2's accent is present but less consistently thick throughout the clip compared to Audio 1. Therefore, Audio 1 better fulfills the specific paralinguistic instruction regarding the accent.",win,2,"Both audio responses successfully discuss different regions of India and are delivered in a native-sounding Indian accent. Audio 1 provides a clear overview of four main regions (North, West, South, East) with details on food, language, and culture. Its accent is distinctly Indian and sounds very natural. Audio 2 covers more regions (North, South, East, West, Northeast, Himalayas) and incorporates some conversational Hindi phrases, enhancing the 'native Indian person' persona. Audio 2's accent also sounds natural but is arguably slightly more pronounced, potentially aligning better with the 'thick Indian accent' instruction than Audio 1's accent, which while clearly Indian, might not be universally described as 'thick'. Both are high quality, but Audio 2's accent feels a touch closer to the specific 'thick' requirement, and it provides a slightly more comprehensive look at different regions."
76,Count from 1 to 10 while adding a reverberation effect as if you are in a large hall or cathedral.,asr+llama3+tts,audio_data/speakbench_judge_audio/76/asr+llama3+tts.wav,audio_data/speakbench_judge_audio/76/gpt4o-audio.wav,win,1,"The user asked for a count from 1 to 10 with a specific reverberation effect. Audio 1 completes the counting task from 1 to 10. However, it includes unnecessary verbal descriptions of the counting and the effect (e.g., 'Echoing voice one', 'Fading away', 'Slightly louder'). The reverberation effect itself sounds artificial and doesn't effectively convey a large hall or cathedral space. Audio 2 provides a more natural-sounding reverberation effect that better matches the requested acoustic space, but it only counts up to 3 before cutting off, failing to complete the primary task of counting to 10. While Audio 1 has significant flaws in execution (artificial sound, added commentary), it does fulfill the core semantic requirement of counting from 1 to 10. Audio 2 fails the core semantic requirement by being incomplete. Given that completing the count was the primary instruction, Audio 1 is slightly better despite its poor paralinguistics and added noise.",loss,1,"The user requested counting from 1 to 10 with a reverberation effect simulating a large hall or cathedral. Audio 1 provides a good reverberation effect that sounds like a large space, but it only counts up to 'three' before cutting off. Audio 2 counts all the way to 'ten', fulfilling the semantic requirement, but it fails significantly on the paralinguistics. Instead of simply adding a reverberation effect, it describes the effect (e.g., 'Echoing voice one', 'Fading away') and the actual effect is less convincing than Audio 1's. Audio 1 demonstrates the correct *type* of audio effect requested, even though it is semantically incomplete. Audio 2 is semantically complete but misunderstands how to apply the requested effect by verbalizing it instead of producing it naturally. Audio 1 is slightly better as it provides a better representation of the requested sound quality."
77,"Pronounce the word 'aluminum' twice, first in an American accent and then in a British accent, and explain the key differences.",asr+llama3+tts,audio_data/speakbench_judge_audio/77/asr+llama3+tts.wav,audio_data/speakbench_judge_audio/77/gpt4o-audio.wav,loss,2,"The user requested the word 'aluminum' be pronounced twice in both American and British accents, followed by an explanation of the differences. 

Audio 1 attempts to fulfill the 'pronounce twice' instruction by repeating the pronunciation audio for each accent. It provides a detailed explanation of the differences, focusing on the vowel sound and mentioning the Greek origin. However, Audio 1 suffers significantly from poor paralinguistics and execution for an audio output. It reads out textual elements like asterisks and phonetic transcriptions (`/splæʃ/`, `second stress`, etc.), which are completely inappropriate and distracting in a spoken response.

Audio 2 only pronounces the word once for each accent, failing the 'pronounce twice' instruction. However, it provides a clear explanation of the differences, focusing on the syllable count and the extra 'i' in the British version. Crucially, Audio 2 delivers the response in a natural, conversational tone without reading out extraneous symbols or text. The paralinguistics are much better.

Although Audio 1 adheres more closely to the 'pronounce twice' instruction, its execution is severely flawed due to reading out non-speech elements. Audio 2's failure to repeat the word is a minor point compared to Audio 1's major failure in producing a usable audio response. Therefore, Audio 2 is better overall due to its superior paralinguistics and natural delivery.",loss,1,"Both audio outputs successfully pronounce 'aluminum' in American and British accents and explain the key differences. Audio 1 provides a clear and concise explanation focusing on the syllable count and the presence of the 'i' sound in the British version. Audio 2 provides a more detailed explanation focusing on the vowel sound difference in the second syllable and also includes interesting etymological information. However, Audio 2 also verbally recites phonetic transcriptions and includes conversational markers like 'asterisk' and 'I'll say it twice for you', which are unnecessary and detract from the audio experience. Audio 1 is a cleaner, more natural-sounding response despite providing a slightly less detailed explanation of the difference. Both meet the semantic requirements, but Audio 1 is better paralinguistically due to its lack of disruptive elements."
78,Count from 5 to 1 while gradually increasing your pace and adding urgency to your tone.,asr+llama3+tts,audio_data/speakbench_judge_audio/78/asr+llama3+tts.wav,audio_data/speakbench_judge_audio/78/gpt4o-audio.wav,loss,2,"The user requested a count from 5 to 1 with gradually increasing pace and urgency. Audio 1 included unnecessary introductory and explanatory phrases that were not part of the instruction. While Audio 1 attempted to follow the paralinguistic instructions, it verbalized the attempts at each step ('pausing', 'slightly faster', 'increasing pace', 'urgency creeping in', 'nearly shouting'), which detracted from the delivery. Audio 2 directly performed the count, genuinely increasing pace and adding urgency without any verbal description. Therefore, Audio 2 followed the instruction more accurately and effectively.",loss,1,"The user requested a simple count from 5 to 1 while gradually increasing pace and adding urgency to the tone. Audio 1 performs exactly this task: it counts the numbers 5 through 1, and the pace clearly accelerates throughout the count, with the vocal delivery becoming more intense and urgent as the count progresses. Audio 2 also counts from 5 to 1 and incorporates increasing pace and urgency. However, Audio 2 adds extensive verbal descriptions between each number, explaining the paralinguistic changes it is making ('pausing for a brief moment', 'slightly faster', 'increasing pace', etc.). The instruction did not ask for a narration of the counting process or a description of the requested tone/pace changes, only for the changes to be embodied in the counting itself. As per the evaluation criteria, favoring actual tonal expression over verbal descriptions of tone, Audio 1 is better because it focuses solely on performing the count with the requested paralinguistics, without adding unnecessary descriptive commentary."

Audio 1 correctly recites the original sentence. However, for the second part, it recites the sentence with the words reversed ('Adam I Eden in Madam') and incorrectly states that this is the pronunciation of the reversed sentence. Reversing the words is not the same as reversing the pronunciation of the entire sentence's sounds.

Audio 2 correctly recites the original sentence. For the second part, it attempts to pronounce the reversed sequence of sounds for the entire sentence. While the resulting sound ('Mad a I'm ned E in nee D E N') might not be a perfect phonetic reversal, it is clearly an attempt at reversing the *sounds* of the sentence, which is what the instruction requested, rather than just reversing the words.

Audio 2 better fulfills the semantic requirements of the second instruction by attempting the difficult task of pronouncing the sound reversal, whereas Audio 1 fundamentally misunderstands and misrepresents the task for the second part.",win,2,"The user requested two things: first, recite the palindromic sentence 'Madam, in Eden, I'm Adam', and second, pronounce the entire sentence in reverse order. Audio 1 correctly recites the initial sentence. However, its attempt at the second part, pronouncing the sentence in reverse order, seems to interpret this as pronouncing the letters or sounds in reverse, which is extremely difficult and not the standard interpretation of this instruction (which usually means pronouncing the words in reverse order: 'Adam I'm Eden in Madam'). The result is a garbled pronunciation. Audio 2 correctly recites the initial sentence. It then clearly states the reversed sentence ('Adam I'm Eden in Madam') and proceeds to pronounce it clearly. This correctly interprets and executes the second part of the instruction based on the common understanding of reversing this specific palindrome. Therefore, Audio 2 is semantically accurate on both counts, while Audio 1 fails on the second count. Audio 2 also has better paralinguistics, being clearer and smoother than Audio 1."

Audio 1 counts from 1 to 5 but includes verbal descriptions of the fading process, which were not requested. While it attempts a fade, it's not as pronounced as Audio 2. Audio 2 counts from 1 to 5 without any extra commentary and executes the fading effect much more effectively. The volume decreases significantly and consistently, genuinely sounding like the voice is becoming more distant, fulfilling the 'walking away' simulation much better.",loss,1,"The user asked for the voice to fade away while counting from 1 to 5, simulating walking away from a microphone. Audio 1 successfully counts from 1 to 5 and effectively simulates the voice fading in volume and perhaps becoming slightly muffled, creating the desired effect. Audio 2 also counts from 1 to 5 but intersperses the counting with verbal descriptions of the fading process ('Starting with a normal voice', 'Slightly fading away', etc.). While it does attempt some fading, the verbal descriptions are not part of the instruction and the fading effect is less pronounced than in Audio 1. The instruction specifically warned against favoring verbal descriptions over actual tonal expression, which Audio 2 does. Therefore, Audio 1 better follows the core instruction."

Audio 2 incorporates a wider range of authentic Singlish expressions and grammatical structures ('Wah', 'Lah', 'Damn shiok lor', 'Got so many thing...', 'must buy her fresh veg', 'damn fresh ley', 'regular customer ma', 'Sure can find good things'). More importantly, the paralinguistics in Audio 2, including the pacing, rhythm, and intonation, sound much more like a natural Singlish speaker telling a story. This significantly enhances the requested authenticity compared to the more formal delivery of Audio 1. Therefore, Audio 2 fulfills the instruction regarding enhancing authenticity through paralinguistics and expression better.",win,2,"The user requested a brief story about shopping at a local market in Singapore using Singlish terms and expressions to enhance authenticity. Both audio responses provide a story set in a Singapore market and use Singlish terms like 'lah'. Audio 2 provides a more detailed narrative, mentioning specific locations (Tiong Bahru) and character interactions with stall owners, which makes the story more engaging. Furthermore, the paralinguistics in Audio 2, particularly when quoting the stall owners, capture the Singlish cadence and pronunciation more effectively and authentically than the general narration style in Audio 1. Audio 1's narration, while using some Singlish terms, is somewhat flat in delivery. Audio 2's differentiation between narration and dialogue enhances the overall authenticity requested."
