However, the naturalness is very poor. The prosody is flat and robotic, with unnatural rhythm and lack of expressive intonation. The voice sounds highly artificial, characteristic of older or basic synthesis methods. The overall quality is significantly negatively impacted by the lack of naturalness, making it sound quite unpleasant and far from a human voice.","The clarity of the speech is acceptable; the words are understandable, though there are subtle digital artifacts present. However, the naturalness is poor. The intonation is very flat, the rhythm is unnatural and somewhat robotic, and there is no discernible expressiveness. The voice sounds distinctly synthesized and lacks any human quality or variation. Overall, the audio is functional for understanding the words but is unpleasant and artificial to listen to, falling below average in quality due to the lack of naturalness.",0.5,standard_cot,somos,0,groundtruth,True,,4.666666666666667,3.642857142857143
