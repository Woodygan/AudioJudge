However, the voice itself is clearly synthesized and lacks naturalness. The intonation is relatively flat, and the rhythm feels somewhat mechanical, without the natural flow of human speech. The timbre is distinctly artificial. While the words are understandable (clarity is acceptable in terms of diction), the lack of naturalness significantly impacts the overall quality. It sounds like a basic text-to-speech system, falling well below what would be considered average or good quality for synthesized speech today.","The speech is clear and understandable at the word level, without significant audio distortions or noise. However, its naturalness is extremely poor. The intonation is flat and unnatural, the rhythm is robotic and lacks human pacing, and there is no sense of expressiveness. It sounds highly synthesized and artificial, clearly lacking the prosodic qualities of natural human speech. This severe lack of naturalness makes the overall quality low, fitting the description of poor quality where the speech sounds artificial.",1.0,standard_cot,somos,0,none,False,,4.666666666666667,3.642857142857143
