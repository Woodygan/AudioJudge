The intonation is flat, lacking natural human prosody and expressiveness. While the words are understandable and there are no overt distortions or noise, the overall lack of naturalness places it at the lowest end of the scale. It fits the description of a voice that 'sounds artificial'.","The speech is intelligible, but it sounds clearly synthesized. There is a noticeable, consistent background resonance or artifact present throughout the clip, particularly audible during pauses. The naturalness is poor, with a very flat intonation, robotic rhythm, and a complete lack of expressiveness. It does not sound like a natural human voice and has audible technical issues. This places it below average in quality.",0.0,standard_cot,somos,0,asr,True,,4.666666666666667,3.642857142857143
