# AudioJudge Examples 📁

This folder contains practical examples demonstrating how to use AudioJudge for various audio evaluation tasks. These examples are derived from our research experiments and showcase real-world applications.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

**Before running these examples, you must first prepare the datasets by running the data preparation scripts in `experiments/main_experiments/`.**

The examples in this folder depend on processed datasets that are generated by the main experiment pipeline.

## Example Scripts

### 📄 `audiojudge_huggingface_demo.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates how to use AudioJudge with real audio data from Hugging Face datasets.
1. It shows how to run pairwise comparison -- the judge appears not to be able to tell the difference between the two audio clips.
2. With ICL examples in the audio concat mode, the judge can tell the difference between the two audio clips.


### 📄 `audiojudge_usage.py`
**Pairwise comparison without instruction audio**

Demonstrates direct comparison between two audio clips.

**Supported Datasets:** SOMOS, THAIMOS, TMHINTQ, pronunciation, speed, speaker

### 📄 `audiojudge_usage_with_instruction.py`
**Pairwise comparison with instruction audio**

Demonstrates system-level comparison where both audio clips are responses to the same instruction.

**Supported Datasets:** ChatbotArena, SpeakBench

### 📄 `audiojudge_usage_pointwise.py`
**Pointwise evaluation**

Demonstrates single audio clip evaluation for absolute quality assessment.

**Supported Datasets:** SOMOS, THAIMOS, TMHINTQ

## Quick Start

### 1. Data Preparation (Required)
```bash
# First, prepare datasets in the main experiments folder
cd ../experiments/main_experiments/
python prepare_dataset.py --dataset_name {name}
cd ../../examples/
```

### 2. Set API Keys
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-key"
```

### 3. Run Example Scripts
```bash
# Pairwise comparison
python audiojudge_usage.py --dataset_name {name}

# With instruction audio
python audiojudge_usage_with_instruction.py --dataset_name {name}

# Pointwise evaluation
python audiojudge_usage_pointwise.py --dataset_name {name}
```
